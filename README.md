# Placement of markers on the map

 [DEMO LINK]()

Implement the following functionality:

- A marker with a number (1, 2, 3, etc.) should be added to each user click on the map. It should be possible to delete markers one by one or all at once.
- Implement the ability to drag and drop markers to update their position on the map. The marker number should remain unchanged.
- Implement clustering of markers if their number exceeds a certain threshold.

## Use technologies:

- `React`
- `TypeScript`
- `Firebase`
- `Google Maps`
- `Git`
- `GitHub`

There must be one main entity:

 A token that stores the following fields:

- Location (latitude, longitude).
- Time of creation (Timestamp).
- Marker number (Quest 1, Quest 2, etc.).
- ID of the next marker.
